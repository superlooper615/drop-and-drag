= CIS 3368 Drag and Drop Example

This code provides an example of using drag and drop with JavaFX.

== Overview
This application demonstrates simple drag/drop between lists. It includes
status changes in the items dropped using an `enum` data type. This status change
illustrates _one_ way that you might change the state of a dragged item. When using
a database, you could

* use a separate table with the status values and included a foreign key
to the status

or

* save the enumerated type to the database either as an integer or a string

When using Spring, one approach when saving the `enum` to the database is to
use the `@Enumerated(value = EnumType.STRING)` annotation. This saves the string
value (in this example, that would be 'Customer' or 'Prospect') to the db
instead of just an integer.

There are pros and cons to each method. Do a search on `java store enums in database`
to get a sense of the different approaches to this problem.
